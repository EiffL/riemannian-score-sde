\section{Discussion and limitations}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we introduced Riemannian Score-Based Generative Models (RSGMs), a class of deep generative models that represent target densities supported on compact manifolds, as the reverse diffusion process of a Brownian motion.
The main benefits of our method stems from its scalability to high dimensions, its applicability to a broad class of manifolds due to the diversity of available loss functions and its capacity to model complex datasets.
We proved that RSGMs are universal generative models for densities supported on compact manifolds. \valentin{universal ?}
Empirically, we demonstrated that our method outperforms previous work on density estimation tasks with spherical geoscience datasets.


% \paragraph{Limitation}
% contrary to NF we cannot estimate using the KL
% ie we need to have access to data and not just the unnormalized density
One current limitation---similarly to other score-based generative models---is the requirement of samples from the targeted distribution, as such models cannot directly fit an unnormalized density.
% Limitation to compact manifold, extension to hyperbolic
% Proof of convergence similar to Theorem 1 in our paper
An important future work direction, and a current limitation, is the manifold compactness assumption.
Several important manifolds do not fit into this category, such as the special linear group, symmetric positive definite matrices or the hyperbolic space which underlies special relativity \citep{ungar2005Einstein}.
\emile{Should write a paragraph in the app on the conditional extension}
Another extension of interest is conditional sampling. By amortizing SGMs with respect to an observation it is possible to approximately sample from a given posterior distribution \citep[see for instance][]{kawar2021snips,kawar2021stochastic,lee2021priorgrad,sinha2021d2c,batzolis2021conditional,chung2021come}.
% Conditional Riemannian SGM (CRSGM).
% Indeed, by amortizing SGM with respect to an observation it is possible to approximately sample from a given posterior distribution, and therefore solve inverse problems, provided that we know how to sample from the corruption model \citep[see for instance][]{kawar2021snips,kawar2021stochastic,lee2021priorgrad,sinha2021d2c,batzolis2021conditional,chung2021come}.
