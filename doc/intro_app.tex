\section{Organization of the supplementary}
\label{sec:organ-suppl}

In this supplementary we gather the proof of \cref{thm:time_reversal_manifold}
as well as additional derivations on score-based generative models and
Riemannian manifolds. In \cref{sec:prel-stoch-riem}, we recall basics on
stochastic Riemannian geometry following \cite{hsu2002stochastic}. In
\cref{sec:diff-betw-ode}, we highlight differences between ODE and SDE 
models for likelihood computation. In \cref{sec:eigenf-eigenv-lapl}, we recall
some basic facts about eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami
operator on the $d$-dimensional sphere and torus. In \cref{sec:time-reversal},
we present the extension of the time-reversal formula to manifold and prove
\cref{thm:time_reversal_manifold}.
